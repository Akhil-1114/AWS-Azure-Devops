Linux
01.) Laptop is connected to router or lan

02.) Each laptop is connected to dns

03.) When we hit a website link where each website link is connected to 2 servers web server and application server

04.) Web server is httpd apache server which hosts ui acts as router for application server

05.) Application server i.e; tomcat server where we place file inside the server and run the server provided by development team which hosts application server

06.) When we pass a request it travels through apache server httpd (ui) and routes through tomcat server and in tomcat server we have actual file with code (backend)

07.) apache server ui code will be in react, angular, framework 

08.) tomcat server backend code will be in java

09.) apache server communicates will google

10.) Any request comes will pass through apache and go through tomcat

11.) The above setup is the post analytics of an application


01.) when 2 servers talk with each other some data transfer is happening

02.) When ever a request is transferred it is converted to bits/chunks of data packets

03.) Laptop has ethernet port

04.) When request is made it pass through router or wifi from port number 8080

05.) Router redirect the request to nearest dns server and dns server maps www.devops.in to the ip address

06.) dns domain name server

07.) dns acts as phone where we search using name

08.) www.devops.in to the ip address convertion takes place at the dns level

09.) ip address is apache server httpd

10.) with the help of route 53 create server name and attach to backend server

11.) The above setup is the pre analytics of an application



01.) when ever you run an application on a server it produces 10.12.15.32/16 running on port number 8080

02.) When we enter 10.12.15.32:8080 application responds with answer
